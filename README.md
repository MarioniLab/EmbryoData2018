# EmbryoData2018

This repo contains a simple script to download the processed data for our manuscript.

Simply run the download.sh script from Terminal/Command Line on a \*NIX system with `wget` installed. If you are on Windows, you'll have to use the integrated Bash command line or else an emulator.

If you don't have wget installed, you can instead get the FTP details by inspecting the script.
