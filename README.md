This repo contains a simple script to download the processed data for our manuscript.

Simply run the download.sh script from Terminal/Command Line on a \*NIX system with `curl` installed. If you are on Windows, you'll have to use the integrated Bash command line or else an emulator.

If you don't want to do the download from the command line, please inspect the download.sh script to find a link to a web address that hosts the file.
